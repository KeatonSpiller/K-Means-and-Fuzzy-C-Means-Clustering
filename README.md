# K-Means-and-Fuzzy-C-Means-Clustering
K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means Clustering

* Python version 3.10 or higher
* Jupyter Notebook

# k means clustering
1. load in the cluster data set txt file

2. Change the hyper parameters

r = 10 # How Many times to run the algorithm
K = 3 # How many cluster's

3. Run the K-Means code block

4. Visualize the K-Means plot

# fuzzy c means clustering

1. Load or Use the previous cluster data set txt file from K-Means

2. Change the hyper parameters

r = 10 # How Many times to run the algorithm
C = 5 # number of clusters
m = 2 # Fuzzifier with m being atleast (m > 1) - clarity of the classification between groups

3. Run the C-Means code block

4. Visualize the Fuzzy C-Means plots
